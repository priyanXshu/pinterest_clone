# Project Title: Pinterest Clone Backend

## Overview

This project is a backend implementation for Pinterest Clone application, focusing on creating a simplified and scalable backend using Node.js, Express.js, MongoDB, and Mongoose. The Pinterest Clone allows users to share and explore various interests through posts.

## Features

- **User Management:**
  - User registration with unique usernames and emails.
  - Password-protected user authentication.

- **User Profiles:**
  - Store and retrieve user details such as full name, email, profile picture, and posts.

- **Posts:**
  - Create, retrieve, update, and delete posts.
  - Posts include text content, creation timestamp, and like count.

- **Database:**
  - MongoDB database integration for efficient and scalable data storage.
  - Mongoose models for structured data representation.

- **Development Tools:**
  - **Nodemon:** A utility that monitors for changes in your source code and automatically restarts your server.
  - **Flash:** A simple middleware for flashing messages to inform users about the status of their actions.
  - **Multer:** A middleware for handling multipart/form-data, used for uploading files (e.g., profile pictures).

## Technologies Used

- **Node.js:** A JavaScript runtime for server-side development.
- **Express.js:** A minimal and flexible Node.js web application framework.
- **MongoDB:** A NoSQL database for storing user and post data.
- **Mongoose:** An ODM (Object Data Modeling) library for MongoDB and Node.js.
